== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I get an account? =

Head to [http://callr.com](http://callr.com).

= What is the E.164 format? =

The [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format is the internationally-standardized format for all phone numbers. E.164 numbers can have a maximum of fifteen digits and are usually written as follows: [+][country code][subscriber number including area code]. Examples: "+16467890800", "+447890123456", or "+33678912345".

= Do the customers need to enter their phone number in the E.164 format? =

Not necessarily. Their number will be automagically converted to the international format if their country is known.

= How many characters can I use? =

The short answer is: as much as you want, you will be billed accordingly ;)

Longer answer: one standard SMS cannot exceed 160 GSM characters, but longer messages will be split into parts of 153 or 67 characters, depending of the encoding. If you are technically enclined (or masochist), you can refer to [this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM_03.38) for more details.
